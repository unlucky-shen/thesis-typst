= Literature Review

This chapter reviews the existing literature regarding document automation and the history of serif fonts in academic publications, specifically focusing on the "Liberation Serif" typeface.

== History of Academic Typefaces
Serif fonts are traditionally preferred for long-form printed text due to their readability. The choice of 12pt font size is a standard that dates back to the early days of professional manuscript preparation.

== Modern Typesetting Alternatives
While LaTeX has been the industry standard for mathematical precision, newer tools like Typst offer a more user-friendly syntax while maintaining the "Justified Text" and "Double Spacing" requirements essential for formal theses.

== The Importance of Margins
The 1-inch margin requirement on all sides (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) is designed to provide enough "white space" for physical binding and examiner annotations.
