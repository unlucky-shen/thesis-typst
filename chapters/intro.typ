= Introduction

Process of academic writing often requires a strict adherence to formatting guidelines. This study investigates the efficiency of using modern typesetting systems to automate the layout process, ensuring that researchers can focus on content rather than margins and font sizes.

== Background of the Study

For decades, students have relied on manual formatting in word processors. However, the requirement for specific spacings—such as the 2.5cm gap between the university name and the faculty—often leads to human error.

== Problem Statement

Traditional tools often fail to maintain consistency across long documents. When a thesis exceeds one hundred pages, manual adjustments to "Justified Text" and "Line Spacing = 2.0" become prone to accidental changes.

== Research Objectives

+ To implement the "Thesis Format" requirements using Typst.
+ To automate the "CHAPTER" heading style and spacing.
+ To provide a scannable and organized template for future students.
